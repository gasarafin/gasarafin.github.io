*SmartTasker* is a multi-faceted to-do manager that assists users with task prioritization regardless of the external factors that may hinder completion. The application accomplishes this by providing weather and location information for relevant tasks to help users better prioritize tasks that may be affected by such. (For example, if the user has to cut the lawn, they need a non-rainy day; or someone who needs to visit the bank is limited by the bank's hours.)
