*BusyBox* is a system for displaying availability of a person/room in a WFH (work from home) environment. This project differs from other solutions because this project is manually controlled and self-contained - instead of being triggered by calendar appointments or a scheduling system, it is set by a button press. Using a wireless mesh protocol, one server device can trigger several client viewers to display whether the person is free or busy.
